1. When undoing a transaction, we cant transfer money out of a credit card account. How would this work?

TODOS for today:
 - Make undoTransaction work properly
 - Let all accounts owned by a user be displayed
 - Finalise what each account does
 - Add a notification system so that Bank Managers can create accounts for users (requestAccountCreation)
 - See that deposits.txt has the required functionality
 - Maybe add a logging system?
 - Document everything properly
 - Finalise UML diagram
 - Check specification one more time
