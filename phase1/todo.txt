TODOS for today:
[X] Make undoTransaction work properly
[X] Let all accounts owned by a user be displayed
[ ] Finalise what each account does
[Phase 2] Add a notification system so that Bank Managers can create accounts for users (requestAccountCreation)
[X] See that deposits.txt has the required functionality
[Phase 2] Maybe add a logging system?
[X] Document everything properly
[Advaya] Finalise UML diagram
[Lorenzo] Check specification one more time
[Hans] Input and output
[X] Remove the static member fields in Account and Transaction
[ ] How are we reading deposits.txt
[ ] Withdraw action: Checking account cannot withdraw; line of credit account can only withdraw 1-3 dollars
