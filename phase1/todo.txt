 - Finalise what each account does
 - Add a notification system so that Bank Managers can create accounts for users (requestAccountCreation) - nvm Phase 2
 - See that deposits.txt has the required functionality
 - Maybe add a logging system? - phase 2
 - Document everything properly
 - Finalise UML diagram
 - Check specification one more time
