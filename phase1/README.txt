To start the program:
    Run BankMachine.main, this is the main method for the entire program.
    Upon the first start, the entire database of clients and accounts will be empty. The only way to make the first login is through the standard BankManager, with username: admin, password: admin. This will give you access to the standard Bank Manager menu.
