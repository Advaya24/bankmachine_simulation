# bankmachine

A program that simulates a single bank ATM, with an administrator known as BankManager and multiple clients. Users only interact with the ATM (no physical bank). They may perfom actions on their accounts as well as profile.


## System Start-up
Run BankMachine.main, this is the main method for the entire program.
Upon the first start, the entire database of clients and accounts will be empty. The only way to make the first login is through the standard BankManager, with username: admin, password: admin. This will give you access to the standard Bank Manager menu. From there, you may add new clients (and then create accounts for those clients).

User input:
    To select options from a menu, simply type the corresponding number and press enter.
