1. When undoing a transaction, we cant transfer money out of a credit card account. How would this work?

TODOS for today:
[X] Make undoTransaction work properly
[X] Let all accounts owned by a user be displayed
[ ] Finalise what each account does
[Phase 2] Add a notification system so that Bank Managers can create accounts for users (requestAccountCreation)
[X] See that deposits.txt has the required functionality
[Phase 2] Maybe add a logging system?
[X] Document everything properly
[Advaya] Finalise UML diagram
[Lorenzo] Check specification one more time
[Hans] Input and output
[X] Remove the static member fields in Account and Transaction
[ ] How are we reading deposits.txt
[currently working again! more testing required] Withdraw action: Checking account cannot withdraw; line of credit account can only withdraw 1-3 dollars
[Phase 2] Enter password twice!
[Phase 2] Add a way that each client has their own Bank Manager
[Phase 2] GUI?

To fix:
[ ] Fix email and phone number input so that it scans for the right formats
[ ] transactions don't work

Questions:
*Why are there 2 displays when only one account was made?
